# About

Quick and dirty Python script to copy ROMs files from local folder to mounted SD card (to be placed handheld retro
consoles, such as the RG351M).

Compare the source and target folder and output a `rsync` command for each file that exists in the source folder, but
not in the target folder. The script only adds files.
